# stm32f4xx_drivers

This repository contains driver code and supporting utilities for the STM32F4xx series of microcontrollers. The drivers are written in C and are intended to provide a foundational layer for embedded development on STM32F4xx devices.

## Features

- Low-level peripheral drivers for STM32F4xx microcontrollers
- Modular and reusable code structure
- Open for extension and integration into custom embedded projects

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Yash241104/stm32f4xx_drivers.git
   ```

2. **Integrate with Your Project**
   - Copy the relevant driver files into your STM32 project directory.
   - Include the header files in your source files as needed.

3. **Build Instructions**
   - Use your preferred ARM toolchain (e.g., STM32CubeIDE, Keil MDK, or GCC) to compile the drivers and your application.
