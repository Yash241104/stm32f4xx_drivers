# STM32F4xx Drivers

This repository contains custom peripheral drivers for the STM32F4xx series microcontrollers, developed in C. The drivers are designed to provide low-level access and control over various hardware peripherals such as GPIO, SPI. These implementations serve as educational resources and building blocks for embedded systems projects using STM32F4xx MCUs.

## Features

- Low-level peripheral drivers for STM32F4xx microcontrollers
- Modular and reusable code structure
- Open for extension and integration into custom embedded projects

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Yash241104/stm32f4xx_drivers.git
   ```

2. **Integrate with Your Project**
   - Copy the relevant driver files into your STM32 project directory.
   - Include the header files in your source files as needed.

3. **Build Instructions**
   - Use your preferred ARM toolchain (e.g., STM32CubeIDE, Keil MDK, or GCC) to compile the drivers and your application.
